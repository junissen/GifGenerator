Gif Generator for HW6 UMN Bootcamp

The Gif Generator automatically generates gifs depending on 90s TV Shows. Six popular TV shows are displayed by default, and the user can add shows to be displayed using the "Add Show" form and submit button. If a Gif Generator button is pressed, 10 still gifs are generated and their rating is displayed. If the gif is pressed, it will animate, and upon repress, un-animate. Pressing a new button will delete the displayed gifs and regenerate according to the button. Pressing the delete button will delete all gifs currently displayed.
